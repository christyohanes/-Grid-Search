# -Grid-Search

we will use a grid search to find the best parameters for an SVR model. The dataset we use is salary_data.csv, namely the salary dataset. In this exercise the model has not been able to properly adjust the pattern to the data. Our goal is to use a grid search to find better parameters for the model.
